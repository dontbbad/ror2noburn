# No Burn

## Description

This mod removes the burn damage over time from Blazing enemy types.

Blazing enemies will still be able to attack and hit the player, but the burn effect will not be applied to the player. 
Flame trails behind blazing enemies will still damage the player, but will not inflict the burn proc.
